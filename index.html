    <p>You can now register for the free Virtual European Juggling Convention 2021 (VEJC). During the event the General
        Assembly for the European Juggling Association (EJA) will take place - which includes voting for the location of
        the 2023 edition of the European Juggling Convention (EJC). Ireland would like your vote!</p>

    <p>The Irish team has been hard at work figuring out the important details for the event, and our proposed site is
        Punchestown Racecourse in County Kildare. The main juggling hall will be nearly 5,000 square metres large, and
        the
        location is well-connected to Dublin Airport.</p>

    <p>At the General Assembly we will be sharing the work we have done so far which includes the full details of the
        site
        layout, the dimensions of the hall, the facilities available on-site, and the crew responsible for putting this
        event together.</p>

    <p>The VEJC will take place from the 23rd to the 25th of July, and the General Assembly is scheduled for 13:00 CET
        on
        Sunday the 25th. We are counting on your attendance to the event, and are eager to share details with you.</p>

    <p>Go raibh maith agat!</p>
