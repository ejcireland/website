        <h1>Vote for Ireland for European Juggling Convention 2023!</h1>
        <p>You can now <a href="https://prereg.eja.net/"">register for the free Virtual European Juggling Convention 2021 (VEJC)</a>. During the event the General
        Assembly for the European Juggling Association (EJA) will take place - which includes voting for the location of
        the 2023 edition of the European Juggling Convention (EJC). Ireland would like your vote!</p>

        <p>The Irish team has been hard at work figuring out the important details for the event, and our proposed site is
            Punchestown Racecourse in County Kildare. The main juggling hall will be nearly 5,000 square metres large, and
            the
            location is well-connected to Dublin Airport.</p>

        <p>At the General Assembly we will be sharing the work we have done so far which includes the full details of the
            site
            layout, the dimensions of the hall, the facilities available on-site, and the crew responsible for putting this
            event together.</p>
